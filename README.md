# Scripts

A collection of my bash and python scripts. Work in progress!

## Getting Started

I write and use these scripts in a Linux environment (WSL 2 Ubuntu 20.04). I expect them to work on MacOS too. For Windows users, I highly suggest setting up the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

## Usage

If you try using any of these, remember to give execute permissions to the script.

```
$ chmod +x script_name.sh
$ chmod +x script_name.py
```

This will allow you to run the scripts like:

```
$ ./script_name.sh
$ ./script_name.py
```

Please refer to comments in the individual scripts for detailed usage information.
